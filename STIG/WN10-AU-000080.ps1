.SYNOPSIS
Ensures auditing of Special Logon successes is enabled to track the use of privileged accounts in compliance with STIG ID WN10-AU-000080.

.DESCRIPTION
This script enforces the STIG requirement WN10-AU-000080 by enabling the audit policy for "Logon/Logoff - Special Logon: Success". 
Special Logon auditing is essential for detecting logon activity by accounts assigned elevated privileges, such as members of the 
Administrators, Domain Admins, or other sensitive groups. These events are critical for tracking privileged access and supporting 
security monitoring, incident response, and forensic investigations. This audit category helps meet security best practices and 
Department of Defense compliance requirements.
