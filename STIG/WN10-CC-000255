.SYNOPSIS
Ensures compliance with STIG ID WN10-CC-000255 by enforcing the use of a hardware-based security device (TPM) for Windows Hello for Business.

.DESCRIPTION
This PowerShell script configures Windows 10 systems to comply with the Department of Defense STIG requirement WN10-CC-000255. 
It ensures that Windows Hello for Business is set to require a hardware-based security device, such as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), 
enhancing credential protection by tying authentication to physical hardware.

The script creates or modifies the following registry key and value:
Path: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\PassportForWork  
Value Name: RequireSecurityDevice  
Type: REG_DWORD  
Value: 1 (Enabled â€” requires a hardware security device)

By enforcing this setting, the system helps prevent credential theft and ensures biometric and PIN authentication are backed by secure hardware. 
After setting the registry value, the script optionally initiates a group policy update to apply the changes immediately.
